## Run
1. flutter pub get
2. flutter run

## Notes
- `assets/services.json` contains 50 sample services.
- Hive stores favorite IDs in a local box named `favorites`.

## Tests
- Unit/widget tests: `flutter test`
- Integration tests: `flutter test integration_test`

## What to extend
- Add more widget tests & integration tests (persistence across restart).
- Replace MockApi with a real remote API by swapping `MockApi` for a network `ApiService`.
